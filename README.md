# Star Trek Timelines Voyage Monitor

**NOTE** This tool is in a very early (pre-release) state. Same disclaimers apply as for the [desktop version](https://github.com/IAmPicard/StarTrekTimelinesSpreadsheet)!

Latest release (if you don't want to build it yourself) is available [here](https://github.com/IAmPicard/STTVoyage/releases).

[More tools and information here](https://iampicard.github.io/)

## Features

### Monitor the captain's log and current voyage status

![Screenshot main](docs/Voyage_Main2.png "main screenshot")

This is the main tab. It updates whenever a new event happens (every 20 seconds).

![Screenshot notification](docs/Voyage_Notification.png "notification screenshot")

The program also displays a notification when antimatter drops below 100. You can choose to recall the voyage at any time from this tab.

![Screenshot Dilemma](docs/Voyage_Dilemma.png "Dilemma screenshot")

When a dilemma is available, a notification will be displayed and you can choose a resolution from within the tool itself.

![Screenshot Return](docs/Voyage_Return.png "Return screenshot")

When the voyage is on its way back (recalled) you can export the log of your voyage (either as plain text or in JSON format).

### Crew

The second tab simply displays the list of crew assigned to the voyage with their respective roles and a skill aggregate table.
